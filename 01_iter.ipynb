    "# Comprehensive Framework for Hospital Ward Discrete-Event Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll create a structured framework in words for developing a hospital ward simulation model using SimPy, based on Penn et al.'s (2020) paper \"Towards generic modelling of hospital wards: Reuse and redevelopment of simple models.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Conceptual Model Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Objectives\n",
    "- Develop a general-purpose discrete-event simulation model for hospital wards\n",
    "- Enable bed capacity planning by testing different ward configurations\n",
    "- Evaluate the impact of same-sex accommodation policies on ward efficiency\n",
    "- Assess how variations in length of stay and arrival patterns affect bed utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "- Bed occupancy rate (overall and by gender)\n",
    "- Patient rejection rate due to bed unavailability\n",
    "- Waiting time for bed assignment\n",
    "- Length of stay distribution\n",
    "- Gender-specific admission and rejection rates\n",
    "- Utilization of swing beds (beds that can accommodate either gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Essential Structural Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Penn et al.'s (2020) archetype model, the framework should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity Types\n",
    "- Patients: Characterized by gender, arrival time, and length of stay\n",
    "- Beds: Differentiated by allocation type (male-only, female-only, or swing beds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- Male beds (fixed allocation)\n",
    "- Female beds (fixed allocation)\n",
    "- Swing beds (flexible allocation based on demand)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processes\n",
    "- Patient arrival process: Typically modeled as a Poisson process or based on empirical data\n",
    "- Bed assignment process: Algorithm that respects same-sex accommodation requirements\n",
    "- Length of stay process: Often modeled using lognormal or gamma distributions as recommended by Penn et al.\n",
    "- Discharge process: Triggered at the end of a patient's length of stay\n",
    "\n",
    "### System States\n",
    "- Number of occupied beds (by type and gender)\n",
    "- Number of patients waiting for admission\n",
    "- Current allocation of swing beds between genders\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Bed Assignment Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm must handle same-sex accommodation requirements as detailed in Penn et al. (2020):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a patient arrives:\n",
    "    - Check availability of gender-specific beds (male beds for male patients, female beds for female patients)\n",
    "    - If available, assign the patient to a gender-specific bed\n",
    "2. If no gender-specific beds are available:\n",
    "    - Check availability of swing beds\n",
    "    - If available, assign the patient to a swing bed\n",
    "    - Update the current allocation of swing beds by gender\n",
    "3. If no beds are available:\n",
    "    - Either reject the patient or place them in a waiting queue\n",
    "    - If queuing, implement a priority system (e.g., first-come-first-served)\n",
    "4. When a patient is discharged:\n",
    "    - Free the corresponding bed\n",
    "    - If there are waiting patients of the appropriate gender, assign the bed to the next patient in queue\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Input Data Requirements and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Data\n",
    "- Arrival patterns: Inter-arrival time distributions or hourly/daily arrival rates\n",
    "- Length of stay distributions: Parameters for the selected statistical distribution\n",
    "- Gender distribution: Proportion of male and female patients\n",
    "- Bed configuration: Number of male, female, and swing beds\n",
    "- Seasonal variations: Changes in arrival rates or length of stay by day of week, month, or season\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Sources\n",
    "- Hospital Information Systems (HIS)\n",
    "- Electronic Medical Records (EMR)\n",
    "- National health databases (e.g., Hospital Episode Statistics in the UK, as referenced by Penn et al.)\n",
    "- Published literature for benchmark parameters\n",
    "- Expert opinion for validation and parameter estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing Requirements\n",
    "- Cleaning and filtering raw data\n",
    "- Statistical distribution fitting for length of stay data\n",
    "- Time series analysis for arrival patterns\n",
    "- Handling of outliers and missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Structured Experimentation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Scenario\n",
    "- Implement the model with parameters from a typical general hospital ward\n",
    "- Run multiple replications to establish baseline performance metrics\n",
    "- Perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Analysis\n",
    "1. **Bed Configuration Experiments:**\n",
    "    - Vary the total number of beds while maintaining the same male:female:swing ratio\n",
    "    - Vary the proportion of swing beds while keeping the total bed count constant\n",
    "    - Test the impact of different male-to-female bed ratios\n",
    "2. **Operational Policy Experiments:**\n",
    "    - Test different admission policies (e.g., strict vs. flexible same-sex accommodation)\n",
    "    - Evaluate the effect of prioritizing certain patient types\n",
    "    - Model weekday vs. weekend staffing and admission patterns\n",
    "3. **Patient Flow Experiments:**\n",
    "    - Vary arrival rates to simulate seasonal fluctuations\n",
    "    - Modify length of stay distributions to reflect changing case mix\n",
    "    - Test the impact of discharge planning interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warm-up Period and Run Length\n",
    "- Determine appropriate warm-up period to eliminate initialization bias\n",
    "- Set simulation run length to capture seasonal variations (typically 1+ years)\n",
    "- Conduct multiple replications (30+) to ensure statistical validity\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Verification and Validation Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification Methods\n",
    "- Code review: Systematic examination of the SimPy implementation\n",
    "- Trace validation: Step-by-step tracking of individual patients through the system\n",
    "- Conservation checks: Ensure all patients are accounted for (arrivals = admissions + rejections)\n",
    "- Extreme condition testing: Test the model with extreme parameter values\n",
    "- Comparison with analytical models: For simple scenarios where closed-form solutions exist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Methods\n",
    "1. **Face validation:**\n",
    "    - Review by hospital staff and domain experts\n",
    "    - Comparison of model structure with real-world processes\n",
    "2. **Historical data validation:**\n",
    "    - Compare simulation outputs with historical ward data\n",
    "    - Use techniques like time series comparison and statistical hypothesis testing\n",
    "3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis:**\n",
    "    - Identify key parameters that significantly affect model outputs\n",
    "    - Ensure these parameters are accurately estimated\n",
    "4. **Cross-validation:**\n",
    "    - Validate against different datasets not used for model development\n",
    "    - Compare with other published models or case studies from Penn et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Guidelines for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Phase:**\n",
    "    - Install SimPy and required libraries\n",
    "    - Create basic simulation environment\n",
