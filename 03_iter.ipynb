    "#### Bed allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the patient arrival step, Perplexity was used to generate code that could take the CSV output from the patient arrivals step and allocate the patients to beds according to the rules as set out in the Penn et al. (2020) paper.  To design the code, Perplexity was provided with the following prompt:\n",

    "\n",
    "*General model logic* \n",
    "\n",
    "All time units in the model are in hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each patient in the model has a unique identifier. The first patient to arrive has an identifier of 0. For each subsequent patient increment the identifier by 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patients, provided in the attached CSV file, arrive at the ward and must be allocated a bed in the ward.  The following parameters apply: \n",
    "\n",
    "There is 1 ward with 5 bays, each with 3 beds in. \n",
    "\n",
    "All people should be allocated to a bed in a ward with the same gender.  The beds should be allocated according to this prioritization of steps: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " 1  If there are spaces in at least bay containing patients of the same gender as the patient to be assigned, then assign the patient to the one with the heist proportion of its beds occupied.  Bay index number is used as a tie break if required. \n",
    "\n",
    " 2  If the patient was not assigned a bed in step 1 and there are any empty bays assign the patient to the bay with the heist index number. \n",
    "\n",
    " 3  If a patient was not assigned a bed in step 1 or 2 and there are any spaces in single rooms available assign the patient to a single room. \n",
    "\n",
    " 4  If the patient was not assigned a bed in step 1, 2 or 3 and there is a patient of the opposite gender in a single room and it is possible to move that patient to an appropriately genered bay move that patient and assign the original patient to the single room. \n",
    "\n",
    " 5  Else assign a short waiting time to the patient and send them back to the queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a CSV output file of the waiting times, and any patient queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All patient types must have their own generator function \n",
    "\n",
    "The model should print out useful information after each event. \n",

    "The model should include a user settable run length. This defaults to 12 months. \n",
