This repository contains the technical appendix for the report “Modelling Hospital Ward Capacity in Python: A Discrete-Event Simulation Study Based on Penn et al. (2020)”. It documents the iterative development process of the simulation model using Jupyter Notebooks, which capture each step of the model’s creation with the assistance of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.
