    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to use the model developed in Penn et al., (2020) to test if it can be implemented using python and used to simulate a similar NHS facility, or other related facility.  There is value in developing models with sufficient flexibility to allow them to be modified for different purposes, although this must weighed against the simplicity of the model, as increased flexibility can lead to a more complex solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The study described in Penn et al, (2020) initially developed the simulation based on a community hospital rehabilitation ward, and was successfully adapted for application to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  In the presented study, we focus on one ward, with female and male patients, where these two groups should be provided beds within areas of the same sex.\n",

    "Define a Patient dataclass with attributes: pid (patient identifier), arrival time, gender, group (choose from 5 groups), los hours (length of stay in hours), max wait, waiting time, and bedallocated.\n",

    "Next, create a WardBay class (with methods can accept(), add patient(), remove patient(), plus occupancy properties) and a HospitalWard class that manages multiple bays and single rooms.\n",

    "The ward allocation logic:\n",
    "1. If a free bed exists, allocate to a bay which has the same gender.\n",

    "occupant into a bay (only allow one level of shuffling).\n",
    "5. Otherwise, the patient waits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, implement simulation processes:\n",
    "• A patient generator function that uses an exponential interarrival distribution to create patients (assigning each to one of 5 groups and setting attributes, including one that affects los hours).\n",
    "• A wait in queue function that retries allocation every 4 hours and makes the patient leave if waiting exceeds max wait.\n",
    "• A treatment process function that simulates the patient’s stay and then calls discharge patient to remove the patient and update metrics.\n",
    "Then write functions to run one simulation replication (returning metrics like final queue length, average/max waiting time, total discharges, and single room swaps) and to run 20 replications per scenario (e.g., Base, HighArrival, LowArrival, MoreBeds, MoreSingles).\n",

The first function simulates the operation of the ward and returns key performance metrics which can be used later for assessing different simulation parameters, and to determine which changes could be the most appropriate for the hospital to adopt in different scenarios.  The function first creates the Simpy environment which can manage the simulation of time and events, then initialises the hospital ward based on setup parameters.  The patient generator is then started, to simulate the arrival of patients over time, also taking into account interarrival time, length of stay, gender distribution and maximum waiting time.  The simulation is then run, and key performance metrics are calculated and returned.\n",

    "This section includes the different scenarios that were assessed with the model.  Different parameters were tested, initially starting with the Base version, against which other scenarios can be compared.  The base model, taken from the study in Penn et al., (2020) includes Interarrival time of 4.0, length of stay of 3.0 (days), 5 bays, 3 beds per bay, and no single bays and a maximum wait of 36 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other scenarios tested were the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. High Arrival** - by reducing the interarrival time a higher rate of arrivals is simulated.  The Interarrival is set to 2.0 and a single bed is introduced while other parameters remain the same as the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Low Arrival** - by increasing the interarrival time to 6.0 a lower rate of arrivals is simulated and a single bed is introduced. Other parameters remain the same as the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. More beds** - the number of beds is increased by increasing the number of bays from 5 to 6.  This provides 3 additional beds to the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. More Singles** - the number of single bays is increased from 1 to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. High Arrival with more beds** - the number of beds per bay is increased to 5, and combined with the high arrival rate.  This tests whether increasing the number of beds per bay can mitigate the impact of higher arrival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. High Arrival with more bays** - the number of bays is increased to 6 (which also increases the number of beds), and combined with the high arrival rate.  This tests whether increasing the number of bays can reduce waiting times and queue lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. High Arrival with more bays 2** - further increasing the number bays to 7 (which also increases the number of beds), and combined with the high arrival rate.\n",

    "**8. High Arrivals with more single beds** - the number of single beds is increased to 5 and combined with the high arrival rate.  This tests whether adding more single rooms can help manage faster arrival rates.\n",
